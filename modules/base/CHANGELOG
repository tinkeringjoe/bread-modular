# Changelog

## 0.4.0
Removed power extension via TRS cables. Even with the regulator it will be noisy.
Now we only support GND syncing via TRS.

## 0.3.1

Update the USB-C socket's copper layer masks for proper soldering.

## 0.3.0
Add USB power support to the base.
When connecting multiple base boards, we are sending 5V & the regulator takes care of stepping it down to 3.3v. This will remove some of the critical noise in the setup.


## 0.2.1
Add two Jack sockets each POWER & GND. So, we can cascase if we needed.

## 0.2.0
Add 3.5mm Jack socket for Power & GND delivery between boards.

* Power: Share both 5V & GND between two boards.
* GND: Share only GND between boards

## 0.1.0
Initial Release
